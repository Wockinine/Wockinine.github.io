  <tr>
    <td>As this was our first lesson on this topic (and the first IT lesson of this year) there was no opportunity to go and do our own work so we just had to follow what Mr Tansley was showing us. This wasn't very interesting but future weeks should improve.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As previously mentioned we were instructed to follow along with what Mr Tansley was doing which severely limited our learning as we were just going over the basics.  Hopefully this improves in following weeks as this wasn't very interesting.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Being able to figure out solutions myself rather than being taught exactly what to do.</td>
